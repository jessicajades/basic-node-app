1. What is a Node module?
    A Node module is a set of functions that you can include in an application. They are similar to JS libraries.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
    Module.exports is the actual result that gets returned from require(). Exports is simply a reference to 
    module.exports. 

3. Why is using exports recommended?
    Using exports is recommended because it is only a reference to module.exports, and therefore any reassignments 
    will not be available outside of the app (resulting in a smaller chance of failure).
